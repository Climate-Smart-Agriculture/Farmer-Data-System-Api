# Farmer-Data-System-Api
The Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP), in collaboration with the FAO and World Bank, aims to digitize and centralize farmer-level data to support data-driven agricultural planning and policy-making in Sri Lanka. This repository contains the Spring Boot API for the system and is configured to use Postgres DB for data storage.
